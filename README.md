# Google Homepage Clone

![Google Homepage Demo](/public/google-homepage.gif)

This project is a simple clone of the Google homepage, created as a learning exercise to practice HTML and CSS. It demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including structuring HTML, styling with CSS, and deployment of the static website.

## Features

- **HTML Structure:** Organized the webpage into semantic containers, including header, main, and footer sections.
- **CSS Styling:** Styled elements using class and ID selectors. Added a bounce effect to the main Google text title for visual appeal and uniqueness.
- **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness ensures the layout adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Deployment:** The project is deployed live on Netlify for easy access.
